---How to use the source code files:

	Each folder corresponds to a lecture, and has an alphabetical prefix so the folders sort in the proper order. The 
	name of the folder has the structure of ALPHA_SECTIONNAME_LESSONNAME.

	Inside each folder, you will find a "Begin" and "Finished" folder. The "Begin" folder contains the source code 		
	you should have when the lecture begins, and the "Finished" folder contains the source code you should have when 	
	the lecture ends.

	Please note, not every lecture has source code.
